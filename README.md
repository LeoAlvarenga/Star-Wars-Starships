> This project was developed for a Front-end Code Challenge, the idea is to  develop its functions as requested in the challenge and create a UI by my own. The Project was created in React using TypeScript and consumes information from a API provided in the challenge description.

# Installation

**You will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) on your machine (if you haven't already installed it), to clone the repository via HTTPS, run this command line in your terminal in the desired folder:**

```git clone https://github.com/LeoAlvarenga/Star-Wars-Starships.git```

SSH URLs allow access to Git repositories via the SSH security protocol. If you have a valid SSH key registered to your Github account, you can clone the repository using this command:

```git clone git@github.com:LeoAlvarenga/Star-Wars-Starships.git```


**Installing Dependencies**

Open the directory where the project was cloned and run the following command in the terminal:

```npm install``` or ```yarn```

# Starting the project

Once the project and all its dependencies have been installed, open the directory where the project was cloned and run the following command in the terminal:

```npm start``` or ```yarn start```

The project will run in development mode.

Open the URL http://localhost:3000 to view the project in your browser.

The page will reload if you make any changes to the code.

You will also have access to the Errors list in the Console.

This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# About the project

This project was built using the following technologies:

**React**

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

**TypeScript**

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale. It was used to make the treatment of the data returned by the api easier, in addition to helping the creation and use of components complementing the intellisense of vscode.

**Styled-Components**

[Styled-Components](https://styled-components.com/) is a CSS-in-JS library used to make easier the building of styles to your components managing your styles to build a more maintainable code.

**Axios**

[Axios](https://axios-http.com/) is a simple promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js. It was used to simplify the HTTP requests to the API.

# Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode and generating coverage reports.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
